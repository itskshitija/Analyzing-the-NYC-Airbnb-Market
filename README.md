# Analyzing the NYC Airbnb Market 

## Table of Contents


### Overview
Airbnb is an online marketplace connecting people who want to rent out their homes with people looking for accommodations in that locale. It currently covers more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries worldwide.

Data analysis on thousands of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. Our main objective is to determine the key metrics influencing the listing of properties on the platform. For this, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. We have found out the distribution of every Airbnb listing based on their location, including their price range, room type, listing name, and other related factors.
