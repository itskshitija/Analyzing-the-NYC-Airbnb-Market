## Overview
Airbnb is an online marketplace connecting people who want to rent out their homes with people looking for accommodations in that locale. It currently covers more than 100,000 cities and 220 countries worldwide.

Data analysis on thousands of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. Our main objective is to determine the key metrics influencing the listing of properties on the platform. For this project, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. We have found out the distribution of every Airbnb listing based on their location, including their price range, room type, listing name, and other related factors.

## Objective

## Summary of Insights
🔰We analyzed the top 10 hosts to identify the one with the most property listings on Airbnb. Our findings show that Michael holds the top spot with 417 listings, making him the host with the highest number of properties. He is followed by David, who has the second-highest number of listings at 403. Additionally, our data reveals that 5,154 hosts have more than one listing on Airbnb.

🔰The data shows that only 1,295 listings were available year-round, indicating a limited number of consistently accessible properties. Additionally, the average number of listings per host is just one, suggesting that most hosts manage only a single property.

🔰The dataset includes five distinct neighborhood groups: Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, Staten Island, and the Bronx. It was found that Manhattan has the highest number of property listings on Airbnb, with a total of 21,661 listings, while Staten Island has the fewest property listings.

🔰Our dataset includes 221 unique neighborhoods, with Williamsburg standing out as the neighborhood with the most property listings, totaling 3,920 listings. It is followed by Bedford-Stuyvesant and Harlem, with 3,714 and 2,658 listings, respectively. Fort Wadsworth has the highest average price, at $800.

🔰The Airbnb NYC listings primarily consist of three room categories: Private room, Entire home/apt, and Shared room. Among these, Entire home/apt has the highest number of listings, making it the most common room type, while the Shared room has the fewest listings. The average price for all listings is $152.72.

🔰According to the dataset, there are a total of 10,052 property listings on Airbnb that have not received a single review. This means that these listings have either not been booked by guests or, if they have been, no feedback has been provided by those who stayed. This lack of reviews could impact the visibility and attractiveness of these listings to potential guests, as reviews often play a significant role in helping users decide on accommodations.

🔰On average, Airbnb listings in this dataset require a minimum stay of 7 nights. This indicates that, generally, hosts prefer longer bookings, possibly to reduce the frequency of turnover and related maintenance tasks.
